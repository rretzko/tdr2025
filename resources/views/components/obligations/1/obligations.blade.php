    <li>
        <b>I understand</b> that I must submit all signed student applications, a Teacher Estimate Form with a copy of
        my NAfME card affixed to the back and a check made payable to CJMEA by the postmark deadline of TUESDAY
        November 28, 2023.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>I understand</b> that I must attend a Director’s meeting at 8a on the morning of the auditions –
        <i>Saturday December 9, 2023 (Snow Date – Saturday December 16, 2023 – 8a)</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>I understand</b> that I must be present for the entire day of the auditions. A sign-in and sign-out sheet
        will
        verify attendance for the day. If I fail to comply with this ruling, my accepted students will be disqualified.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>I understand</b> that if, for any reason, I am unable to serve at the auditions, I will provide a substitute
        who is a current member of NAfME and I will provide a copy of their current NAfME card to the Registration
        Manager.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>I understand</b> that if I have students accepted into either the REGION II MIXED CHORUS or TREBLE CHORUS,
        I have a second responsibility to assist with a rehearsal or at the concert. If I have students accepted into
        both ensembles, I serve two total duties: once at auditions and once upon student acceptance. The choices of a
        second duty include rehearsal assistant at ONE rehearsal for either MIXED or TREBLE CHORUS, providing assistance
        for the entire day of the concert or serving as a host school for a rehearsal.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>I will sign up</b> for this second Director’s Duty on the day of auditions.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>I understand</b> that if I am serving as both Choral and/or Band/Orchestra Director in my school, I may
        choose to
        serve either the CJMEA Chorus or the CJMEA Band or Orchestra.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b><u>I will let the Registration Manager (<a href="mailto:barbararetzko@hotmail.com" target="_NEW">Barbararetzko@hotmail.com</a>)
                know if I will be serving the instrumental auditions and not the choral auditions!</u></b>

    <li>
        I understand that if I fail to fulfill the responsibilities to the 2024 REGION II MIXED CHORUS or TREBLE CHORUS,
        my student participation will be forfeited the following school year.
