        <b>I understand</b> that I must submit all signed student applications and a Teacher Estimate Form with a copy
        of
        my NAfME card affixed to the back by the postmark deadline of TUESDAY November 22, 2024.

        <b><u>NEW</u></b>: Individual student payments are now processed through SQUARE. This is the default online
        payment option.

    <li>
        <b>I understand</b> that if I have students accepted into either the REGION II MIXED CHORUS or
        TREBLE CHORUS, I have a second responsibility to assist with a rehearsal or at the concert. If I
        have students accepted into both ensembles, I serve two total duties: once as adjudicator and once
        upon student acceptance. The choices of a second duty include rehearsal assistant at ONE rehearsal
        for either MIXED or TREBLE CHORUS, providing assistance for the entire day of the concert or
        serving as a host school for a rehearsal.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>I understand</b> that I will need to complete the Background Check and Training component in order to
        provide a certificate to prove I am cleared for student contact during rehearsals and the concert. If I
        need assistance with this process, I will contact President Brian Williams at
        <a href="mailto:president.cjmea@gmail.com" class="text-blue-500">president.cjmea@gmail.com</a> .
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>I understand</b> that if I fail to fulfill the responsibilities to the 2025 REGION II MIXED CHORUS or TREBLE
        CHORUS,
        my student participation will be forfeited the following school year.
